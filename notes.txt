NPM Configs
===========

> npm set init-author-name
> npm set init-author-email
> npm set init-author-url
> npm set init-license

Check ~/.npmrc to get details about config!

Another property for saving dependency :
-----------------------------------------
save-exact - Tells NPM that whenever it is saving a dependency to your package.json, it would be the exact version instead of a version range.
             This protects you for when people don't use semver properly or if there's a mistake in the release. 
             This also makes upgrading dependencies have fewer surprises.

> npm set save-exact true


NOTE: 
    If you don't have save-exact, in package.json, next to every dependecy listed you'd have a ^ or ~ symbol!

To login to npm in command line:
------------------------------
> npm adduser
After this, an authToken will be generated for you and will be in npmrc!

NPM init
========

1. entry point :
            This is what will be used when you require the package/module as in require('starwars-names-learning_test
            We shall set it to src/index.js

2. test : 
            Leave it as blank for now because we'll add tests later
