NPM Configs
===========

> npm set init-author-name
> npm set init-author-email
> npm set init-author-url
> npm set init-license

Check ~/.npmrc to get details about config!

Another property for saving dependency :
-----------------------------------------
save-exact - Tells NPM that whenever it is saving a dependency to your package.json, it would be the exact version instead of a version range.
             This protects you for when people don't use semver properly or if there's a mistake in the release. 
             This also makes upgrading dependencies have fewer surprises.

> npm set save-exact true


NOTE: 
    If you don't have save-exact, in package.json, next to every dependecy listed you'd have a ^ or ~ symbol!

To login to npm in command line:
------------------------------
> npm adduser
After this, an authToken will be generated for you and will be in npmrc!

NPM init
========

1. entry point :
            This is what will be used when you require the package/module as in require('starwars-names-learning_test
            We shall set it to src/index.js

2. test : 
            Leave it as blank for now because we'll add tests later            


To publish to NPM:
=================

>npm publish


To get info: 

> npm info <package_name>

This would give you info like you have in package.json 

Shortcut to package in npm:
===========================

Go to npm.im/<package_name> to go directly to the package page

Releaseing a version to Github:
===============================

One important aspect is to associate the version you have on npm with the version on the Github repository.
You accomplish this by adding a version tag to the Github repo.
A tag in Git is something that points to a particular commit so that you can easily go back to that commit

>git tag 1.0.0
>git push --tags

This will show up in the branches place inside a separate tab called Tags.

To delete a tag,
> git tag -d <tag_id>

Github will also consider this tag as a release and you will be able to see it in the releases tab in the tab menu above the branch dropdown
You could also draft a new release in that page - if the tag id is an existing tag, it just edits it (adds more info)


Releasing a new version to NPM
==============================

1. Make the change to src
2. Go to package.json and change the version number - but make sure you change it according to the rules of semantic versioning 
    First - major version - when you have a major release - a breaking change
    Second - minor release - new features - no breaking change
    Third - patch release - a bug fix
